                Logically, using this implementation promises to drastically reduce web latency especially where 
                fetching information from the network can prove very slow. Although answering the question about whether
                this implementation should be used is actually a question about tradeoffs...
                
                With this implementation, the user will always get data loaded from the cache since that promise ideally should be resolved first, 
                and thus we are embracing a tradeoff of the user getting a stale content eventually if the cache is not synced(or up to date) with the 
                resource from the network (DB).
                And also, there is a risk of the promise getting shortcircuited when fetchFromNetwork promise is rejected before the cache promise is resolved, 
                which will leave our users with no resource to work with or get displayed which is bad.
                
                Although, to manage the tradeoffs, it is better for us to use Promise.any because this will return the first fulfilled promise 
                regardless of the other rejected promises (even if the rejected promise was the first to get completed).
                Also, to extend this further, an expiration can be placed for the resources on the cache to ensure that periodically, the cache promise is rejected, 
                and thus forces us to wait for the updated resource from the network (DB).
