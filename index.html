                Logically, using this implementation promises to drastically reduce web latency especially where 
                fetching information from the network can prove very slow. Although answering the question about whether
                this implementation should be used is actually a question about tradeoffs...
                
                With this implementation, the user will always get data loaded from the cache since that promise ideally should be resolved first, 
                and thus we are embracing a tradeoff of the user getting a stale content eventually if the cache is not synced(or up to date) with the 
                resource from the network (DB).
                And also, there is a risk of the promise getting shortcircuited when fetchFromNetwork promise is rejected before the cache promise is resolved, 
                which will leave our users with no resource to work with or get displayed which is bad.
                
                Although, to manage the tradeoffs, it is better for us to use Promise.any because this will return the first fulfilled promise 
                regardless of the other rejected promises (even if the rejected promise was the first to get completed).
                Also, to extend this further, an expiration can be placed for the resources on the cache to ensure that periodically, the cache promise is rejected, 
                and thus forces us to wait for the updated resource from the network (DB).

    <!-- <h2>Case Questions</h2>
   
    <pre style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular';">
        <strong> Case 1:</strong> case 1 shall evaluate your understanding of the promise concept in javascript.
        In dealing with read latencies in web applications, one of the solution is to cache the data that you just retrieved from the DB and in the subsequent request, respond to the request for data from the cache without hitting the database. 
        Seems very easy and straight forward right?
        
        The code below appears to race the cache against the network, using the fastest returned resource. 
        
        Promise.race([getFromCache, fetchFromNetwork])
        .then(function(resource) {
            console.log('Fastest resource:', resource);
        })
        .catch(function(reason) {
            console.log('Could not get resource:', reason);
        });
        
        Do you think I should implement this?
    </pre>

    <pre style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular';">
        Case 2: This second case below evaluates your logical reasoning capabilities and understanding of dynamic programming:
        Given var cointypes = [25, 10, 7, 2], Run a loop based on the coin types and using the greedy algorithm, return number of each type of coin we can have, if we were given 191 naira. Please note that i want your result in pyramid form (i believe you know how a pyramid looks like). I want this implementation in javascript and then in PHP.
